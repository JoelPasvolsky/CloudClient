features:
  - |
    Disable client use while ``Client.close()`` is in progress by failing with
    ``UseAfterCloseError``. Also, make sure the close operation is thread-safe.

    A follow-up to `#680 <https://github.com/dwavesystems/dwave-cloud-client/pull/680>`_.
upgrade:
  - |
    Remove ``Client.session``, an undocumented and unused client attribute. If
    still needed, can be replaced with ``Client.create_session()``.
