  - |
    Update sample set creation in ``dwave.cloud.computation.Future`` to support
    dimod 0.12.18+. Previously, ``wait_id()`` method used to be added to the
    ``from_future``-created sample sets in the cloud-client, and now the ``SampleSet``
    interface propagates ``wait_id`` from the future by default.
    See `dimod#1392 <https://github.com/dwavesystems/dimod/issues/1392>`_ and
    `dwave-system#540 <https://github.com/dwavesystems/dwave-system/issues/540>`_.
