fixes:
  - |
    Defer SQLite connect in ``@cached.ondisk()`` until actually needed. Also,
    verify cache thread/process-safety and forking support.
  - |
    Fix ``get_cache_dir()`` to not create the cache directory by default. Creation
    is now optional and controlled with ``create`` argument. This makes it consistent
    with other config path functions.
  - |
    Fix possible race condition during cache directory create.
