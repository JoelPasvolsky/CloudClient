    Parse ``Cache-Control`` header field if present in API response, and use it
    to guide local caching policy.

    This means ``dwave.cloud.api.DWaveAPIClient`` and ``dwave.cloud.api.resource``
    classes now respect origin server response caching policy.
    See `#646 <https://github.com/dwavesystems/dwave-cloud-client/issues/646>`_.
