upgrade:
  - |
    Positional arguments in ``dwave.cloud.Client`` constructor, deprecated in 0.10.0,
    are removed in 0.12.0. Use keyword arguments instead.
  - |
    Alias keys ``samples`` and ``occurrences`` (for ``solutions`` and ``num_occurrences``)
    in the results dict of ``dwave.cloud.computation.Future.result()``, deprecated in
    0.8.0, are now finally removed in 0.12.0. We'll try to keep the result dict as close
    to raw data returned by SAPI as possible. Postprocessed data is instead available
    via ``dwave.cloud.computation.Future`` properties.
