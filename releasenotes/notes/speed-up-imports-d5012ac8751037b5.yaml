    Lazily import ``Client``/``Solver``/``Future`` in the top-level namespace,
    ``dwave.cloud``. Direct imports are preferred, e.g.
    ``from dwave.cloud.client import Client``, but the widely-used way
    (``from dwave.cloud import Client``) is still supported for backwards
    compatibility.

    Similarly we now lazily import old namespaces with client type as submodule,
    e.g. ``dwave.cloud.qpu``.

    The main benefit of such lazy imports is import performance, as "heavy"
    symbols are only imported when explicitly needed/asked for.
