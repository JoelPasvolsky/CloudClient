    More robust ``Client.close()``.

    Client use after close is now disabled. An attempt to submit a problem, poll
    for a status, or download an answer will now result in an ``UseAfterCloseError``
    exception.

    Also, solvers and computations now only weakly reference the client, so they
    don't block client resources cleanup.

    See `#217 <https://github.com/dwavesystems/dwave-cloud-client/issues/217>`_.
