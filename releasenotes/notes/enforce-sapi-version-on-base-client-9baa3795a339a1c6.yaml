features:
  - |
    Convert ``requests.Session`` subclasses in ``dwave.cloud.api.client`` to
    mixins. ``BaseUrlSessionMixin``, ``LoggingSessionMixin``,
    ``PayloadCompressingSessionMixin``, ``VersionedAPISessionMixin`` and
    ``CachingSessionMixin`` can now be combined and used independently of each
    other.
deprecations:
  - |
    The following ``requests.Session`` subclasses are deprecated in favor of their
    mixin variants: ``LoggingSession``, ``PayloadCompressingSession``,
    ``VersionedAPISession``, ``CachingSession``. They'll be removed in
    dwave-cloud-client 0.15.0.
