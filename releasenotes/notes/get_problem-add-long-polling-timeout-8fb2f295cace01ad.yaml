    Add ``timeout`` keyword argument to ``api.resources.Problems.get_problem()``
    method.

    Use it to enable long polling on problem fetch API endpoint. The connection
    is closed (server-side) when the problem completes, or the ``timeout``
    (in seconds) elapses, whatever comes first. In case problem completed in
    time, problem answer is returned in addition to problem status (which is
    always returned).
