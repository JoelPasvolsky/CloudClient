fixes:
  - |
    During solver metadata filtering, treat solver ``status`` as a dynamic field.
    This is to handle an edge case when solver is marked ``offline``, but it's
    still available via API.

features:
  - |
    Cache dynamic solver metadata for up to 15 minutes, unless defined
    differently by API cache control response header.
