features:
  - |
    Lazily import ``Client``/``Solver``/``Future`` in the top-level namespace,
    ``dwave.cloud``. Direct imports are preferred, e.g.
    ``from dwave.cloud.client import Client``, but the widely-used way
    (``from dwave.cloud import Client``) is still supported for backwards
    compatibility.

    Similarly we now lazily import old namespaces with client type as submodule,
    e.g. ``dwave.cloud.qpu``.

    The main benefit of such lazy imports is import performance, as "heavy"
    symbols are only imported when explicitly needed/asked for.
  - |
    Speed-up imports by slightly decoupling submodules.
deprecations:
  - |
    Shorthand import paths for specialized Clients (for ``qpu``, ``sw`` and
    ``hybrid``) are deprecated in ``dwave-cloud-client==0.12.2`` and will be
    removed in ``dwave-cloud-client==0.14.0``. Instead, use the full import
    path, e.g. ``from dwave.cloud.client.qpu import Client``, instead of
    ``from dwave.cloud.qpu import Client``.
