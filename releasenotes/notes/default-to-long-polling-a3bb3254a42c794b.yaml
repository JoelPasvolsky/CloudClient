    Poll for problem status update using long polling strategy by default.

    Long polling strategy enables faster status change propagation to the client,
    especially for longer jobs, or during heavy QPU usage.

upgrade:
  - |
    Short polling with exponential backoff is not used by default anymore, but
    it is still available. If for some reason you want to use it, set::

      poll_strategy = backoff

    configuration parameter in your config file, or the keyword argument in calls
    to ``Client()`` or ``Client.from_config()``.
