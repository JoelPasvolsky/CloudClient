    ``dwave.cloud.utils`` module has been split into the following submodules:
    ``dwave.cloud.utils.cli``, ``dwave.cloud.utils.coders``,
    ``dwave.cloud.utils.decorators``, ``dwave.cloud.utils.dist``,
    ``dwave.cloud.utils.exception``, ``dwave.cloud.utils.http``,
    ``dwave.cloud.utils.logging``, ``dwave.cloud.utils.qubo``, and
    ``dwave.cloud.utils.time``.

    First reason for doing this was code clean-up (including adding type annotations),
    but a more important reason is that this will enable import time optimization
    in the future. And that's why we break backwards compatibility by not importing
    everything back into the top-level utils namespace.

    The utils module is considered Ocean-internal as is, so this move shouldn't
    affect user's code.
