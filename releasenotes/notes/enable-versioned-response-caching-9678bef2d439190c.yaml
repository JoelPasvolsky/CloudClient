features:
  - |
    Pass-through unused keyword arguments in ``dwave.cloud.utils.http.BaseUrlSessionMixin``
    constructor. This enables mixing with session mixins from ``dwave.cloud.api.client``
    in any order.
  - |
    Enable ``DWaveAPIClient`` to properly cache different API response representation
    versions by reordering session mixins. Caching layer is now below the API version
    handling, hence capturing changes from the versioning layer.
  - |
    Facilitate cached content validation and parsing by caching the response content
    type as part of metadata in ``dwave.cloud.api.client.CachingSessionMixin``.
