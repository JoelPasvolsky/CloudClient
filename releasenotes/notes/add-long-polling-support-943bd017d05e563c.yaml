features:

    Add long polling as problem status/answer polling strategy.

    We add the following config options: ``poll_strategy`` (``"backoff"`` is the
    current default, ``"long-polling"`` is the new strategy), ``poll_wait_time``,
    and ``poll_pause``.

  - |
    Add ``timeout`` keyword argument to ``api.resources.Problems.get_problem_status()``
    and ``api.resources.Problems.get_problem_statuses()`` methods.

    Use it to enable long polling on problem status API endpoint. The connection
    is closed (server-side) when at least one problem completes, or the ``timeout``
    (in seconds) elapses, whatever comes first.
